maternal_mortality_rate = """
Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) is the number of women who die due to pregnancy-related problems per 100,000 live births within a certain time period. These deaths can happen during pregnancy, childbirth, or up to 42 days after giving birth. The main causes are complications like heavy bleeding, infections, high blood pressure, and unsafe abortions, many of which can be prevented with proper care.

MMR is an important measure of how good a country's healthcare system is, how easy it is for women to get medical help, and the overall living conditions. In wealthier countries, lower MMR is due to good healthcare, trained doctors, and access to prenatal and postnatal care. In poorer countries, higher rates happen because of limited access to healthcare, poverty, and lack of education. 

To reduce maternal deaths, it is important to improve healthcare, ensure skilled help during childbirth, and provide timely medical care to all women.

Teenagers, especially those under 20, face higher risks due to physical immaturity, while women over 35 also experience increased risks due to age-related complications like high blood pressure, diabetes, and fertility issues. Women in their 20s to early 30s generally have the lowest risk, as their bodies are physically more equipped for pregnancy. Therefore, both very young and older mothers are at higher risk for complications during pregnancy and childbirth.")

To reduce these differences, itâ€™s important to improve healthcare access and make sure all women get fair and timely care.")

st.text("To help fight racial bias in healthcare, we can create a Medical Bias Reporter system. This would allow patients and healthcare workers to report any instances of racial discrimination or unfair treatment. The system would be easy to use, letting people submit anonymous reports about biased behavior. These reports would be reviewed to find patterns, train staff, and make improvements. By using this tool, healthcare systems can become more aware of issues and work towards fairer and more equal treatment for everyone.")
